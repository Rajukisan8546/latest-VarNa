Dynamic Gradient Background Changer
Project Overview
The Dynamic Gradient Background Changer is a web application that allows users to change the background color to a randomly generated gradient with the click of a button. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive, visually pleasing gradient transitions. It's a great example of using JavaScript for DOM manipulation and generating random color values to create dynamic and engaging effects.

Smooth Transitions: The background changes with a smooth, visually appealing transition effect.
User Interaction: Simple and intuitive interface, where the user interacts with just a single button.
Customizable: Easy to modify the code to include different color ranges or add more complex functionality.
